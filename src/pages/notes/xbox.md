But this Box is nonfree and uses DRM
------------------------------------

Yes, I know, but this is a dedicated machine I use only for exactly these tasks. I use free software where I can. My phone and my computer run mostly free software (driver or BIOS blobs are sadly a thing though).

Xbox Series S
-------------

I have an Xbox Series S with my own little neat customizations added to it like a purple accent color (purple is one of my favourite colors).

Game and app list
-----------------

-   Apex
-   Knockout City
-   Fortnite
-   Minecraft
-   Minecraft Dungeons
-   Overwatch
-   Sonic Generations
-   Netflix
-   Spotify
-   YouTube
-   Twitch
-   Unigram

Gamepass
--------

-   I started using Gamepass since March 2021 for 1‚Ç¨ (first month, afterwards 12,99‚Ç¨/month) and it absolutely slaps
-   The included EA Play subscription in Gamepass came to PC and now I started playing Sims 4
-   Of course I will use Gamepass on my Xbox alongside Xbox Gold to play online games
-   Microsoft began dropping the Xbox Gold requirement for free-to-play multiplayer games

Hidden features/Easter eggs

The Xbox PSU has a little Master Chief engraved into it. Neat detail! üëç

xCloud for Xbox consoles coming soon
------------------------------------

I'm currently working on getting a Gigabit internet connection running in my home while at the same time waiting for xCloud on consoles being released in Holiday 2021. This is great, because then I don't have to store all my games on my Xbox's SSD all the time and save some space with games I play with friends only.
