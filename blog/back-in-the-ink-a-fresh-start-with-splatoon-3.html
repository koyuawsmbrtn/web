                    For a while, my Switch Lite sat forgotten, gathering dust in the corner. I had moved on to other things, including The Finals, my competitive shooter of choice on Linux. But a recent disaster—when The Finals completely broke after a frustrating update—finally pushed me to dust off my old console. The game wouldn’t even launch anymore, and after countless tweaks to make it work on Linux, I was done. I needed something fresh, and that’s when I found Splatoon 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve never been part of the Splatoon craze. I missed the hype around the first two games, never owned a Wii U, and didn’t get into the series until the third installment. But once I fired up Splatoon 3, I was hooked immediately. This game is something else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vibe of Splatoon 3? Electric. The city is vibrant and full of life, and the music is a hyperactive blend of squid-pop that matches the action on screen. But beyond the charming aesthetic, the core gameplay is what keeps me coming back. It’s a turf war where your weapon of choice is ink, and the goal is to cover as much ground as possible while splatting opponents. It’s addicting. The strategy involved in choosing your weapons, balancing your loadout, and coordinating with teammates makes it feel less like a simple shooter and more like a competitive dance with ink and paint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And now, with the official announcement of the Switch 2, I’m even more excited. Sure, there have been rumors and leaks for months, but the real deal is finally here. As we inch closer to its release, I can’t help but imagine how Splatoon 3’s ink-splattering chaos will look on a beefier console with better graphics and smoother framerates. But despite the hype for the new hardware, there’s something oddly satisfying about revisiting a system that’s past its prime. It’s like rereading a favorite book before you dive into a new series—familiar but still thrilling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, though, I’m content to stay in the world of Splatoon 3. It’s the right game at the right time. I’m having a blast dodging rollers, launching Tenta Missiles, and trying to keep up with the player who’s always just a little bit too good. The ink might dry eventually, but right now, I’m just soaking in every colorful, chaotic moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for The Finals, I’ll be back once the game recovers from its latest break. Version 5.6 has completely broken the game on Linux, and until that gets patched, I’m staying in Splatoon 3’s world of ink-splattered mayhem. Here’s to new memories, one splash at a time.
