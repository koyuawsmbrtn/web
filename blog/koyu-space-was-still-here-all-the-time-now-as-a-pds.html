                <h1>koyu.space was still here all the time ‚Äì now as a PDS!</h1>
                <p class="date">Published on February 20, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    koyu.space has been quietly present for a while, but it‚Äôs been a little less vocal about its existence lately. That‚Äôs changing now. koyu.space has evolved into a Personal Data Server (PDS), making it part of the decentralized social web.
                </p>
                <h2>What does that mean?</h2>
                <p class="my-3">koyu.space now operates on the <a href="https://atproto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol)</a>, the same protocol that powers <a href="https://bsky.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a>. Unlike traditional social media platforms, where all your data is locked into a single company‚Äôs walled garden, a PDS lets you have more control over your information. You‚Äôre not just the product ‚Äì you‚Äôre the one holding the keys to your own data.</p>
                <p class="my-3">If you were part of koyu.space before, or you‚Äôre curious about what‚Äôs different now, I‚Äôm opening up invites for the next chapter of this journey! If you‚Äôd like to join, just reach out to me, and I‚Äôll send you an invite.</p>
                <h2>Bluesky vs. Mastodon</h2>
                <p>While we‚Äôre on the topic of decentralized platforms, let‚Äôs talk a bit about how Bluesky compares to Mastodon ‚Äì two popular alternatives to traditional social media.</p>
                <p>Both are part of the Fediverse, but Bluesky runs on the AT Protocol, while Mastodon uses ActivityPub. The AT Protocol offers some key advantages:</p>
                <ol><li><strong>Improved Scalability and Performance</strong>: Bluesky‚Äôs protocol is designed with scalability in mind. It handles large volumes of traffic and user data with greater efficiency, making it a smoother experience for users. Mastodon, on the other hand, can sometimes struggle with performance due to its decentralized nature, especially on smaller instances.</li><li><strong>Better Data Control</strong>: The AT Protocol gives users more control over their data. It allows for features like private profiles, content moderation at the individual level, and greater customization. Mastodon does offer some of these features, but Bluesky‚Äôs implementation is more streamlined and accessible.</li><li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Bluesky‚Äôs user interface is sleek and designed with simplicity in mind. It‚Äôs easy to navigate, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about joining a specific instance or server to participate. Mastodon can be more complicated for newcomers because it requires joining specific instances that have different rules, policies, and content moderation standards.</li><li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: Bluesky, due to its protocol design, is built to be more compatible with other platforms and social networks in the future. It provides a strong foundation for expanding the decentralized web. Mastodon has made incredible progress, but its ecosystem still feels somewhat segmented.</li><li><strong>Storage Efficiency</strong>: One of the standout advantages of Bluesky is that it doesn‚Äôt fill up your storage the way Mastodon can. Mastodon‚Äôs backend is notoriously inefficient, and my previous instance on Mastodon collected over <strong>3TB</strong> of data before it was shut down. This massive amount of data just from running an instance made it increasingly difficult to maintain and scale. Bluesky‚Äôs more efficient infrastructure ensures that data doesn‚Äôt accumulate unnecessarily, making it far easier to manage.</li></ol>
                <p class="my-3">That said, both Bluesky and Mastodon are excellent options for those looking to move away from centralized social media. It all comes down to what you value more: performance and scalability, or community-driven moderation and openness.</p>
                <p>If you‚Äôre ready to explore a more decentralized way of socializing, join koyu.space and start engaging with a new kind of platform.</p>
                <p>See you there! üöÄ</p>
