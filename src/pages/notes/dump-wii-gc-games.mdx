This guide shows you how to properly dump your Wii or GameCube (GC) games using CleanRip.

## Requirements

* An SD card or USB drive with at least 4.7 GB of free space (8.5 GB when copying a dual layer disc).
* [CleanRip](https://github.com/emukidid/cleanrip/releases/latest)

## Guide

### Step 1: Download and install

1. Unzip CleanRip and move it to the `apps` folder on your SD card.
2. Insert your SD card into your Wii and launch CleanRip from the Homebrew Channel.

### Step 2: Copy

1. Choose the device you want to copy the game to - your USB drive or SD card.

2. The screen will ask if you want to download a file with checksums so you can make sure a full copy of the disc was made. It is your decision to answer yes or no to the question about downloading the file.

3. Now insert the disc you want to copy.

<Warning>If you copy <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Dual_Layer_Disc_games" target="_blank">one of the 13 games on this list</a>, choose dual layer if CleanRip asks you about it.</Warning>

4. Set everything up like below

5. CleanRip will now copy your game. This may take a while as it copies the full 4.7GB of content from the disc (9.4GB on dual layer discs).
