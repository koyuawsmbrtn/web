            Hi, Iâ€™m koyu (usually called Leonie in real life) and I am a programmer and sysadmin located in Northern
            Germany establishing internet services for you and your friends. Iâ€™m your average computer nerd trying
            to liberate the cyberspace for everyone.

                                        because of the camera why didn't you buy a camera in the first place? I know it
                                        sounds stupid, but really having a thing that does a thing well instead of one
                                        thing that does everything bad equally, why not keeping it simple?</p>
