The EU wants to make messaging services like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Teams, Element, Signal etc. interoperable meaning that a seemless communication between those services would be possible. This sounds great at first, because you only need one app and nothing else, but if not handled correctly this might end up in the same mess we're finding us in today. Cryptocurrencies can't be the answer as well [for obvious reasons](/why-ai-cryptocurrency-metaverse-and-all-that-crap-doesnt-matter/).

## Introducing Matrix

The Matrix does one thing differently than the others: federation and bridging. You can literally bridge all your favourite chat apps into one app and have only one app that rules them all. It's also fairly [easy](https://t2bot.io) to set up. If you're hosting your own server, hosting a bridge is as easy as setting up a Docker container and add one line to a config file.
