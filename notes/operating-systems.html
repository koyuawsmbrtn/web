                <h1>Operating systems</h1>
                <p>I do run and develop a few operating systems, some in-house, some open-source for anyone to use.</p>
                <h2>koyuwatch</h2>
                <p>An internally used RTOS based on the Watchy firmware. It&rsquo;s a simple OS with support for weather
                    information, time syncing and also includes support for paying via Revolut and contact information
                    for people to scan.</p>
                <p>An early version of koyuwatch missing the WiFi indicator and wonky display of battery levels</p>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong> working</p>
                <p><strong>Architecture(s):</strong> Watchy based on the ESP32 microcontroller</p>
                <p><strong>First version:</strong> Aug 12 2024</p>
                <p><strong>Use case(s):</strong> Smartwatches</p>
                <p><strong>License:</strong> proprietary</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>BreezeOS</h2>
                <p>BreezeOS is a proprietary operating system designed for i386 (and later) retro computers. Loaded into
                    the memory of the machine it supports switching out floppy disks during runtime. This allows a user
                    to load the operating system using one floppy and use another floppy for programs. The only
                    supported resolution is 640&times;360 using 16 colors. The operating system was based on MikeOS, but
                    has later been fully rewritten and extended with ACPI support and other features. It&rsquo;s heavy
                    use of BIOS registers for system calls makes it unportable to other architectures and platforms. The
                    operating system is like a mix between Unix and DOS. It doesn&rsquo;t support sound other than PC
                    speakers and drawing directly on the screen is also only possible through a video driver implemented
                    into the application. Due to the bad design programs are limited to 32kb in memory.</p>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong> working</p>
                <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> x86, i386 and later</p>
                <p><strong>First version:</strong> circa 2013</p>
                <p><strong>Use case(s):</strong> Retro computers, virtual machines, general purpose OS</p>
                <p><strong>License:</strong> proprietary</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Sharpy</h2>
                <p>An operating system written in C# using the Cosmos SDK. Similar to BreezeOS it&rsquo;s an operating
                    system aimed at x86 retro computing. It tried to replace it, but ultimately failed due to the lack
                    of a proper filesystem driver or fully working init system. The idea was that due to the codebase
                    being in C# rather than raw assembly language it would&rsquo;ve been easier to maintain.</p>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong> abandoned</p>
                <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> x86</p>
                <p><strong>First version:</strong> circa 2018</p>
                <p><strong>Use case(s):</strong> Retro computing, successor to Breeze OS</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
