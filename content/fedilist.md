title: Instance recommendations
---

This is a list of instances I will recommend and meet all my requirements to be a good and welcoming space while having common sense.

## Requirements to be listed

  * Your instance is older than six months (can&#8217;t be checked that easily, so I just take when the domain for the instance has been registered)
  * You don&#8217;t block too many instances so that it makes it harder for your users to communicate
  * Either you openly publish your blocklist or tell me who you blocked. Again, I want people to communicate.
  * The admins are easily reachable and users can come to them whenever they have a problem and get on-point answers to their problems. A user forum would be nice, but not necessary.
  * You are 100% sure your instance will live on for a long period of time
  * Regular backups of user data or any other data safety measures
  * GDPR compliant (e.g. no Google Analytics and allowing users to request or delete their data, hosting preferably EU-based)
  * Transport layer security (TLS) so packets are safe and sound when being in transit (this doesn&#8217;t mean admins or law enforcement are not permitted to read your messages, if you want safe communication use an encrypted messaging service like Element)
  * You guarantee a certain amount of uptime (ideally >90%)
  * Your instance shouldn&#8217;t be too generalist that it&#8217;d look plain and boring (mastodon.social and mstdn.io you are sadly out of luck here)
  * Your instance should have less than 50k users so they are spread out evenly (who&#8217;s gonna pay for all that bandwidth)
  * Your instance should stand out from the mass (theme it, add mods..whatever you feel like)
  * Data mining is a big no-no which also includes selling user data to Facebook. Stop it, it&#8217;s disgusting. This is why we are on the fediverse.
  * Your instance can run any software (Pleroma, Misskey, Mastodon, &#8230;)
  * Must have open registrations (invite-only or manual approval okay)
  * Shouldn&#8217;t be a single user instance
