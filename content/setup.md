title: Current tech setup and lifestyle
---

I'm trying to keep my belongings as minimal as possible which is a lifestyle called minimalism. I don't own much, but I own enough to get stuff done. I'm also trying to live as ecofriendly as possible by buying used hardware or getting them gifted by friends or family.

-   Xbox Series S
-   Sony CMT-EH25 Soundsystem
-   Acer X223w (Gen 2) display
-   Fujitsu beige display with 1280Ã—1024 resolution sometimes connected if I need a second display
-   Nokia G20 with Android One
-   Nokia 6300 4G running KaiOS for development purposes, not a daily driver
-   HP 255 G6 laptop with 4GB RAM and some crappy AMD CPU running koyuOS called Luna
