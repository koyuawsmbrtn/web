This whole debacle started when Apple kind of unveiled a way to do QI charging, even though devices like the Nexus 5 (which I own) had this technology almost a decade ago. Now that Apple can't use their lightning port anymore since the EU now wants to force every device manufacturer to produce USB-C devices (despite the awful spec mess) the future for their devices might seem cordless, but it isn't.

## Cordless means horrible UX

Most people nowadays assume that they can plug their charging cable and headphones into their phone, but even the latest Pixel Phones ditched the 3.5mm audio jack. This is frustrating though, because going cordless means throwing away all your cables thus producing more e-waste. My partner complained (and still complains) about their new and shiny phone not having an audio jack. This is also the reason why most of my phones are either Nokia smartphones or really old ones, because they still have the headphone jack. It's still in use today and I hope phone manufacturers know that it's still in use. Don't assume what your users do with your device, rather ask them what they expect from your device before you build it.

## Cordless means more money for the rich

Since anyone with some degree of technical knowledge can invent a wireless spec over night it's a matter of time how long it will take until some random company decides to bind your device to their specific range of approved products. This might sound very Apple to you, but they actually recently kind of hinted towards iPhones getting their well-deserved USB-C port after so many years.

## Is cordless the future?

No, definitely not. Going cordless is the most horrible future one can imagine as you use control over your device, face vendor lock-in and destroy your environment.
