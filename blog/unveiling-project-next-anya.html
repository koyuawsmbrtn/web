                    <b>Update June 24, 2025: </b>
                    I have since added the original fans back to the case, because passive cooling is not
                    sufficient under heavy load.
                </blockquote>
                <p>When you&rsquo;re building a gaming PC that combines performance, efficiency, and longevity, you need
                    to be deliberate with each component. In my recent build, I&rsquo;ve focused not only on performance
                    but also on ensuring the rig is <em>passively cooled</em> &ndash; an often overlooked approach that
                    keeps things silent without sacrificing functionality.<br />Let&rsquo;s dive into the hardware and
                    explore how it all comes together in a fanless system that&rsquo;s built to last.</p>
                <h2>1. AMD Ryzen 5 7600X: The Heart of the System</h2>
                <p>With 6 cores and 12 threads, the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X running at 4.70 GHz is a mid-range powerhouse.
                    Whether I&rsquo;m gaming, working on productivity tasks, or even handling light workstation duties,
                    this CPU excels thanks to its excellent single-core performance and respectable multi-threading
                    capabilities. The decision to go with the Ryzen 5 7600X wasn&rsquo;t just about performance,
                    though&mdash;its efficient Zen 4 architecture ensures it runs cool, making it perfect for a
                    passively cooled system.<br />In a fanless setup, temperature management becomes even more critical,
                    and the 7600X&rsquo;s balance between speed and thermal efficiency makes it an ideal choice for my
                    needs.</p>
                <h2>2. Alphacool Core Ocean T38 AIO 360mm: Efficient Passive Cooling</h2>
                <p>While most gaming PCs rely on traditional fans, I&rsquo;ve opted for a 360mm Alphacool Core Ocean T38
                    AIO to handle the cooling. The beauty of this setup is that the large radiator surface area
                    efficiently dissipates heat, even without active airflow. Paired with the low TDP of the Ryzen 5
                    7600X, this AIO provides enough cooling to keep temperatures under control during intense gaming or
                    high-performance workloads.<br />Choosing a passive approach means no noise, less dust buildup, and
                    a sleeker overall design. It also requires careful planning when it comes to component placement and
                    heat distribution, but the result is a rig that runs cool and quiet.</p>
                <h2>3. MSI Pro A2620M-E Motherboard: The Foundation</h2>
                <p>The MSI Pro A2620M-E motherboard offers everything I need for this build: reliable performance, PCIe
                    4.0 support, and great compatibility with the rest of the hardware. It&rsquo;s a no-nonsense choice
                    that ensures stable performance, ample connectivity, and enough headroom for future upgrades.</p>
                <h2>4. 1TB Kingston NV2 NVMe M.2: Fast Storage for Years</h2>
                <p>Storage is critical in any build, and I went for the 1TB Kingston NV2 NVMe M.2 SSD to ensure I get
                    the fastest speeds with minimal power consumption. Its PCIe 4.0 interface and 3D NAND technology
                    provide ultra-fast read and write speeds, ideal for loading games, large files, or
                    multitasking-heavy workflows.<br />Not only does it minimize power usage, but its compact M.2 form
                    factor also means no additional airflow is required for cooling&mdash;perfect for this fanless
                    build.</p>
                <h2>5. be quiet! Pure Power 11 700W: Silent and Efficient Power Supply</h2>
                <p>For power, I&rsquo;m using the 700W be quiet! Pure Power 11, which fits perfectly with the silent
                    theme of this rig. It&rsquo;s non-modular, but the 80+ Gold efficiency ensures minimal heat
                    generation and power waste, a must when running a passively cooled system. Plus, be quiet! is known
                    for its reliability and silent operation, which is crucial when building a system with no fans.</p>
                <h2>6. NVIDIA GTX 1660 SUPER: Good Performance Without Excessive Heat</h2>
                <p>The NVIDIA GTX 1660 SUPER is an excellent match for my needs. While it&rsquo;s not the latest and
                    greatest, it delivers more than enough power for modern gaming at 1080p75fps. The card also runs
                    relatively cool, which is a big win in a passively cooled setup. This is also only the noisy part of
                    my rig while the rest remains whisper-quiet.</p>
                <h2>7. Lian Li DAN A3-mATX: Compact Case, Sleek Design</h2>
                <p>The Lian Li DAN A3-mATX is the ideal case for this build. It&rsquo;s compact, minimalist and stylish.
                    The case&rsquo;s design allows for passive cooling to work effectively, as it is optimized for
                    airflow even without traditional fans. A minor hiccup was needing a USB2 header adapter to get the
                    USB-C front port up and running.</p>
                <h2>8. Crucial Pro DDR5 RAM: Fast and Future-Proof</h2>
                <p>Finally, the 32GB Crucial Pro DDR5 RAM (running at 5600MHz in Dual-Channel) ensures that my rig
                    won&rsquo;t bottleneck during intensive gaming or multitasking. DDR5 is the future, and at 32GB, I
                    have plenty of headroom for the coming years. Its low power consumption also makes it a great match
                    for a passively cooled system, reducing heat output and ensuring efficient performance.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion: The Future of Silent Performance</h2>
                <p>This build is all about creating a balance&mdash;powerful enough for today&rsquo;s gaming and work
                    needs while remaining quiet, efficient, and cool enough to function without traditional fans. With
                    careful component selection, such as the Ryzen 5 7600X and the Alphacool AIO, this rig is a
                    testament to what&rsquo;s possible when you push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s expected in PC
                    cooling.<br />By eliminating fans, I&rsquo;ve created a system that&rsquo;s not only silent but
                    efficient and future-proof&mdash;ready for years of gaming and productivity without compromising on
                    performance.</p>
